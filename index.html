In C++ I've also developed a Quadtree representation of a PNG image fully equiped with compression and decompression features. As well, I have implemented DFS and BFS fill algorithms in gif images. In C, I have developed a Soduku solver and logic for a self autonomous car with an Arduino and transistor-transistor logic.  </div>

       <div class = "halfColumnRight"><h1>Other Personal Projects</h1>
I've also created a web scrapper tool for NFL stats and a simple algorithmic trading simulator. Currently, I am taking a Udacity course in Machine Learning. I have self-studied iOS and Web Development.  </div>
